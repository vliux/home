It is the automated utility tool for synchronizing family data written in Python. 
I'm using it (with Jenkins) to backup my family photos/docs from the server machine to more than one storage devices.

Requirements:
1. Python 2.6, 2.7

Run it with 'python RunBackup.py --dest <destination> --content <content_type>'
